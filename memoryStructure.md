# How memory is used

Exception get concatenated in a linked list. This is done to manage exceptions in multiple nested functions.    
Each exception needs to have the following fields:
- Pointer to parent exception, if has parent. The parent exception is an exception that happened in a lower level function and may have generated the higher level exception.
- Pointer to child exception, if has child. The child exception is an higher level exception that is generated by the exception.
- Numeric ID of exception.
- String that describes the exception in a human understandable way.

  
This kind of structure is defined for each exception:
| Name                        | Size            | Description                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pointer to parent exception | Size of pointer | Pointer that points to the lower level exception. Null if there is no lower level exception.                                                  |
| Pointer to child exception  | Size of pointer | Pointer that points to higher level exception. Null if there is no higher level exception.                                                    |
| Exception code              | 4 bytes         | Code that identifies the exception that happened in function N. May be used by higher level functions to identify the exception and handle it |
| Exception string            | ?               | Describes in a human readable way the exception that happened.                                                                                |
